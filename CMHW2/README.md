#CM-HW2: 
build an app that offers a weather forecast. 
The user should, first, select the city of interest (from a limited list of cities) and then get the forecast for the upcoming days(for the selcted city). 
The app should make use of fragments (and RecyclerView) and offer two layout arrangements(“landscape” and large diagonal; “normal” screen).
